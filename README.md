# ColorRamp
Create Color Ramps for use with shaders or scripts.

Use `Assets->Create->Color Ramp` to create a new ColorRamp asset. 

A ColorRamp asset simply creates and updates a Texture2D as a sub asset.

Controls are available to adjust each gradient, add new gradients to the stack, reorder the gradients, and tweak the vertical transition between gradients.

Ramps default to Clamp and Bilinear. As these are Texture2D sub assets, you can select them in the project browser to adjust those properties.

A MaterialPropertyDrawer is provided for use with hand-written shaders (Shader Graph does not yet support custom property drawers).

## API
In C# you can `.Evaluate` a ramp.

This samples the underlying texture with GetPixelBilinear, so it's not something you want to be doing every frame.

eg.

```
public Color Evaluate(float u)
ramp.Evaluate(0.5f); // the middle of the ramp
```
```
public Color Evaluate(Vector2 uv)
public Color Evaluate(float u, float v)
ramp.Evaluate(0.1f, 0.6f); // sample a 2D ramp with u and v coordinates (normalised 0-1)
```
